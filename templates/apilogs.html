            Welcome to the API logs! Only the safe, anonymous stuff makes it to the public facing logs.
        </p>
        <p>
            This log shows whenever someone accesses one of the API routes on this site. Each request is logged with a timestamp and the endpoint that was hit.
        </p>
        <p>
            Itâ€™s part of the secure, lightweight, monitoring infrastructure that powers the dashboard. It is built entirely in Python + SQLite.
